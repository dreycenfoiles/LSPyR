  abstract = {The principles underlying a new method of refractometry of living cells are discussed. The method was evolved from the chance observation that the amoebocytes of the blood of the earthworm, examined in their own blood, appeared bright instead of dark by positive phase-contrast microscopy. This was shown to be due to the presence of dissolved haemoglobin which raised the refractive index of the medium above that of the cytoplasm. In order to determine the refractive index of the latter it was only necessary to dilute the blood until the cytoplasm became virtually invisible. Non-pigmented proteins and other high molecular weight substances have now been substituted for haemoglobin.},

Measured values correlate with those obtained from theoretical models of the NStars using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which we use to simulate the extinction spectra of the nanostars. Finally, because NStars are typically used in biological applications, we conjugate DNA and antibodies to the NStars and calculate the footprint of the bound biomolecules.},

In this work, optical bowtie nanoantennae with varying geometries were simulated, fabricated, and characterized. We successfully fabricated sub-5 nm gaps between prisms. The gap between prisms, the prism size, and the radius of curvature of the prism corners were characterized for their effects on the optical and electromagnetic properties. Bowties were characterized using LSPR, SERS, and photochemical near-field imaging. The results indicate that the radius of curvature of the prism corners has an important effect on the SERS abilities of a nanoparticle array. The trends described herein can be utilized to intelligently design highly sensitive SERS and LSPR biosensing substrates.},

  abstract = {DDSCAT 7.3 is an open-source Fortran-90 software package applying the discrete dipole approximation to calculate scattering and absorption of electromagnetic waves by targets with arbitrary geometries and complex refractive index. The targets may be isolated entities (e.g., dust particles), but may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays of "target unit cells", allowing calculation of absorption, scattering, and electric fields around arrays of nanostructures. The theory of the DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine (1988) and Draine \& Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures in Draine \& Flatau (2008), and efficient near-field calculations in Flatau \& Draine (2012). DDSCAT 7.3 includes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). DDSCAT supports calculations for a variety of target geometries. Target materials may be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is straightforward for the user to "import" arbitrary target geometries into the code. DDSCAT automatically calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering and selected elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix for user-specified scattering directions. DDSCAT 7.3 can efficiently calculate E and B throughout a user-specified volume containing the target. This User Guide explains how to use DDSCAT 7.3 to carry out electromagnetic scattering calculations, including use of DDPOSTPROCESS, a Fortran-90 code to perform calculations with E and B at user-selected locations near the target. A number of changes have been made since the last release, DDSCAT 7.2 .},

Biacore system can be employed for biomolecular interactions, selection procedures, epitope mapping, molecular discriminations, kinetic analyses, screening processes and other applications.

The next generation of synchrotron facilities that are currently under design or construction throughout the world will provide diffraction-limited X-ray sources and are expected to boost the current data rates by several orders of magnitude, stressing the need for the development and integration of efficient analysis tools. Here an attempt to provide a collaborative framework for the analysis of synchrotron tomographic data that has the potential to unify the effort of different facilities and beamlines performing similar tasks is described in detail. The proposed Python-based framework is open-source, platform- and data-format-independent, has multiprocessing capability and supports procedural programming that many researchers prefer. This collaborative platform could affect all major synchrotron facilities where new effort is now dedicated to developing new tools that can be deployed at the facility for real-time processing, as well as distributed to users for off-site data processing.},

  abstract = {The chromosome-centered RanGTP gradient, which is strongly reduced in slow-growing normal cells, is amplified by chromosomal gain and is required for mitosis in rapidly growing aneuploid cells., Many mitotic factors were shown to be activated by Ran guanosine triphosphatase. Previous studies in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and in highly proliferative cells showed that mitotic chromosomes were surrounded by steep Ran guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentration gradients, indicating that RanGTP-activated factors promote spindle assembly around chromosomes. However, the mitotic role of Ran in normal differentiated cells is not known. In this paper, we show that although the steep mitotic RanGTP gradients were present in rapidly growing cell lines and were required for chromosome congression in mitotic HeLa cells, the gradients were strongly reduced in slow-growing primary cells, such as HFF-1 fibroblasts. The overexpression of RCC1, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran, induced steeper mitotic RanGTP gradients in HFF-1 cells, showing the critical role of RCC1 levels in the regulation of mitosis by Ran. Remarkably, in vitro fusion of HFF-1 cells produced cells with steep mitotic RanGTP gradients comparable to HeLa cells, indicating that chromosomal gain can promote mitosis in aneuploid cancer cells via Ran.},

Here, we report the development of a novel localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensing approach for investigating one aspect of microtubule dynamics that is not well understood, namely, nucleation. Using a modified Mie theory with radially variable refractive index, we construct a theoretical model to describe the optical response of gold nanoparticles when microtubules form around them. The model predicts that the extinction maximum wavelength is sensitive to a change in the local refractive index induced by microtubule nucleation within a few tens of nanometers from the nanoparticle surface, but insensitive to a change in the refractive index outside this region caused by microtubule elongation. As a proof of concept to demonstrate that LSPR can be used for detecting microtubule nucleation experimentally, we induce spontaneous microtubule formation around gold nanoparticles by immobilizing tubulin subunits on the nanoparticles. We find that, consistent with the theoretical model, there is a redshift in the extinction maximum wavelength upon the formation of short microtubules around the nanoparticles, but no significant change in maximum wavelength when the microtubules are elongated. We also perform kinetic experiments and demonstrate that the maximum wavelength is sensitive to the microtubule nuclei assembly even when microtubules are too small to be detected from an optical density measurement.},

Simulations show that both LSPR and SERS can be tuned by changing the gap slanting angle. The SERS enhancement factor can also be improved by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the one reached using a rounded gap. Therefore, the slanting angle can be used as a new control parameter in the design of SERS substrates to guarantee stronger field confinement and higher sensitivity, especially as its feasibility is demonstrated.},

When compared with a conventional radiograph, which is an image of many planes superimposed on each other, a CT image exhibits significantly improved contrast although this is at the expense of reduced spatial resolution. A CT image is reconstructed mathematically from a large number of one-dimensional projections of the chosen plane. These projections are acquired electronically using a linear array of solid-state detectors and an x-ray source that rotates around the patient. X-ray computed tomography is used routinely in radiological examinations. It has also been found to be useful in special applications such as radiotherapy treatment planning and three-dimensional imaging for surgical planning.},

In the  accompanying paper3, we suggest that microtubules nucleated by centrosomes can grow transiently at  tubulin concentrations below those at which free microtubules are stable, and that nucleated  microtubules coexist as shrinking and growing populations which rarely interconvert. This behaviour  is clear only when individual microtubules rather than bulk populations are studied. Here we  generalize the results from microtubules nucleated by centrosomes to free micro\- tubules. We  examine the detailed kinetics of microtubule assembly to try to account for these unusual dynamic  properties.},

The model relates the peak wavelength of light scattered by an individual plasmonic nanoparticle to the number of bound analyte molecules and provides an analytical formulation that predicts relevant figures-of-merit of the sensor such as the molecular detection limit (MDL) and dynamic range as a function of nanoparticle geometry and detection system parameters. The model calculates LSPR shifts for individual molecules bound by a nanorod, so that the MDL is defined as the smallest number of bound molecules that is measurable by the system, and the dynamic range is defined as the maximum number of molecules that can be detected by a single nanorod. This model is useful because it will allow a priori design of an LSPR sensor with figures-of-merit that can be optimized for the target analyte. This model was used to design an LSPR sensor based on biotin-functionalized gold nanorods that offers the lowest MDL for this class of sensors. The model predicts a MDL of 18 streptavidin molecules for this sensor, which is in good agreement with experiments and estimates. Further, we discuss how the model can be utilized to guide the development of future generations of LSPR biosensors.},

Consequently, cells need to exert tight control over when, where and how many microtubules are being made. Whereas the regulation of microtubule dynamics is well studied, the molecular mechanisms of microtubule nucleation are still poorly understood. Next to the established master template of nucleation, the {$\gamma$}-tubulin ring complex, other microtubule-associated proteins that affect microtubule dynamic properties have recently been found to contribute to nucleation. It has begun to emerge that the nucleation efficiency is controlled not only by template activity but also by, either additionally or alternatively, the stabilization of the nascent microtubule `nucleus'. This suggests a simple conceptual framework for the mechanisms regulating microtubule nucleation in cells.},

  abstract = {The plasmonic properties of single silver triangular nanoprisms are investigated using dark-field optical microscopy and spectroscopy. Two distinct localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) are observed. These are assigned as in-plane dipolar and quadrupolar plasmon excitations using electrodynamic modeling based on the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The dipole resonance is found to be very intense, and its peak wavelength is extremely sensitive to the height, edge length, and tip sharpness of the triangular nanoprism. In contrast, the intensity of the quadrupole resonance is much weaker relative to the dipole resonance in the single particle spectra than in the ensemble averaged spectrum. Several parameters relevant to the chemical sensing properties of these nanoprisms have been measured. The dependence of the dipole plasmon resonance on the refractive index of the external medium is found to be as high as 205 nm RIU-1 and the plasmon line width as narrow as {$\sim$}0.17 eV. These data lead to a sensing figure of merit (FOM), the slope of refractive index sensitivity in eV RIU-1/line width (eV), as high as 3.3. In addition, the LSPR shift response to alkanethiol chain length was found to be linear with a slope of 4.4 nm per CH2 unit. This is the highest short-range refractive index sensitivity yet measured for a nanoparticle.},

  abstract = {This Account provides an overview of the methods that are currently being used to study the electromagnetics of silver and gold nanoparticles, with an emphasis on the determination of extinction and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra. These methods have proven to be immensely useful in recent years for interpreting a wide range of nanoscience experiments and providing the capability to describe optical properties of particles up to several hundred nanometers in dimension, including arbitrary particle structures and complex dielectric environments (adsorbed layers of molecules, nearby metal films, and other particles). While some of the methods date back to Mie's celebrated work a century ago, others are still at the forefront of algorithm development in computational electromagnetics. This Account gives a qualitative description of the physical and mathematical basis behind the most commonly used methods, including both analytical and numerical methods, as well as representative results of applications that are relevant to current experiments. The analytical methods that we discuss are either derived from Mie theory for spheres or from the quasistatic (Gans) model as applied to spheres and spheroids. In this discussion, we describe the use of Mie theory to determine electromagnetic contributions to SERS enhancements that include for retarded dipole emission effects, and the use of the quasistatic approximation for spheroidal particles interacting with dye adsorbate layers. The numerical methods include the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and the finite element method (FEM) based on Whitney forms. We discuss applications such as using DDA to describe the interaction of two gold disks to define electromagnetic hot spots, FDTD for light interacting with metal wires that go from particle-like plasmonic response to the film-like transmission as wire dimension is varied, and FEM studies of electromagnetic fields near cubic particles.},
